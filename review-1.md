###Lesson 1

1. Machine code is instructions for computers.
2. Source code is written in human language and compiled into machine code.

###Lesson 2

3. Use `//` for one-line comments, `/* */` for multiline comments.
4. Preprocessor, Compiler, Assembler, Linker.
5. Syntactic / Semantic bugs.

###Lesson 3

6. `2`
7. `++i` (`i++`) add `1` to `i` before (after) `i` is evaluated.
8. `myVar *= 5`
9. `a = b` would set the value of `a` to `b`.
10. `%f`
11. Parameters are variables which are required by functions.
12. Just how they are called.
13. `2`, `2.5`

###Lesson 4

11. Nothing. `if(i)` is equivalent to `if(i != 0)`, and in this case `i == 0`.
12. `||`
13. The initialization sets initial variables. The loop condition controls if the loop will repeat or not. The step value changes the initial variables.

###Lesson 5

14. Segfaults are caused by programs which try to read or write an illegal memory location (such as a negative index).
15. `9`
16. It can cause segfaults.
17. `"a"`.
18. `char`
19. `<cstring>`, or `<string>` if we use `std::string`.
